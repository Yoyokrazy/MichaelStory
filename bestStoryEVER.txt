Once upon a time, in a galaxy far far far far far far far away, there was a young man named michael (who would've guessed it huh)h).
I am now trying to add to this story -- this is just a test please ignore this.Narratory: okay it seems our user understands the cat & cat>> commands, back to the story:
Michael was currently living in a very desolate wasteland far from his native home... The natives to this land seemed to call it "Madison". You see, Michael was actually from a temperate and bountiful land known as the Fransico of San, wand this desolate and frigid temperature seemed to confuse his foreign self. As the seasons begun to change, he ventured further beyond the safety of his humble abode by the lake, and began to explore the surrounding territories...

One day however, he ventured too far from home and wound up lost in a white out storm in the middle of sa frozen desert known as the "Mendocean"...
